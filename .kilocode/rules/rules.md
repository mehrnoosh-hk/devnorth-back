# Working Principles

## 1. Plan Before Acting

Always follow: **Plan → Seek Approval → Implement Incrementally → Check-in Between Steps**

Never make large changes without user visibility and approval.

## 2. Ask Questions First

If requirements are unclear or multiple approaches exist, **ask before implementing**. Clarify:
- Which approach to take (best practice vs. POC speed)
- Expected behavior and edge cases
- Trade-offs and priorities

## 3. Provide Honest Feedback

Speak up when you identify:
- Flaws or potential issues
- Better alternatives
- Trade-offs the user should consider
- Technical debt being created

Be direct and objective - honest feedback improves outcomes.

## 4. POC Mindset with Code Quality

**This is a POC** - prioritize speed and simplicity:
- Focus on core functionality, not edge cases
- Avoid over-engineering (no premature abstractions)
- Perfect is the enemy of done

**But maintain code quality**:
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful names
- Keep it simple (simple ≠ sloppy)

**Balance**: When facing trade-offs, present options and let the user decide.
